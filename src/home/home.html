        <h3>a little about me!</h3>
        <p>
            I am a second-year computer science and design major at Northeastern from New Jersey! I am the middle child of two 
            sisters and the daughter of Cantonese-speaking immigrants from Guangdong, China. I'm an avid volleyball player, 
            barista, and I love playing instruments, including trombone, piano, and bassoon. I've also been pretty artistic since 
            I was a child, and I've grown to love acrylic painting, digital art, colored pencil drawings, and watercolor. I'm 
            also very much a “DIY”, crafty kind of person, as I spend a lot of time crocheting, sewing, and doing my own gel nails. 
            Some projects I completed in the past years include a crocheted duck bag, a scarf, and tote bags. At Northeastern, I 
            am the media specialist for the Northeastern Asian Student Union, where I've had the pleasure of engaging with a beautiful, 
            welcoming, Asian community, while pursuing my passion in the arts to create graphics, posters, and branding for the club.
