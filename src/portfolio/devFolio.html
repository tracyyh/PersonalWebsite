            <p>At first glance, this website is a little ugly, and it only works for one option that is offered.
                However, what you are looking at is the very first project I have coded.
                By the summer of 2021, I had previously taken a course in computer science and coding with java, but I
                had not built a single project yet. In August 2021, I had the pleasure
                of attending the coding boot camp, Kode With Klossy, where I learned how to development websites within
                2 weeks! I worked with a team of three other high schoolers to develop a
                website that served to assist international students in assimilating into their new environments abroad.
            </p>
            <p>Using the online IDE, Replit, we implemented our website in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I worked
                extensively on the CSS portion of the development, implementing hover features,
                imager carousels, and organizing the different structures of the site. Additionally, I implemented the
                multiple forums across the site as well as the quiz to test a student's French
                skills! Though this project was not one of my best works by all means, I thought it was important to
                share the project that really kickstarted my interest in and launched me into
                the world of computer science and web development!

            <p>In one of my fundamental computer science courses at Northeastern, Object Oriented Design, we were
                assigned to
                develop a functioning game of Battleship, played through the console of an IDE. The goal of this
                assignment was
                to understand the design concept of MVC, or model, view, and control. This was built entirely with Java,
                and includes
                extensive use of inheritance, arrays, and maps.
            </p>
            <p>The project comes in two parts. The first part was to develop a Battleship program that allows a human
                player to
                battle against a computerized player, that takes shots according to the code, whether it be random or
                strategic. Click
                "view code for manual play" to see this code. The second part of this assignment was to take our code
                from part one, make
                it connect to a server, and have other AI players play against the computerized player from our code. On
                the final day of
                this assignment, students were asked to set up their programs to have their codes battle each other,
                tournament style.
                Conceptually, this meant connecting the opponent's AI and having it act as the human player, providing
                input for our computerized
                player to respond to and play against.
            </p>
            <p>Part two of this project required us to rely on JSON objects and messages that align with the messages
                sent by the server.
                This was done through a proxy, which delivered and took in JSON arguments and messages between our AI
                and the opponent AI's plays
                sent by the server. Additionally, part two was completed in two-person teams and my team ended up using
                my partner's code, which
                is why the code for AI play appears different from the code for manual play. I worked extensively on the
                developing the proxy to
                match server input and outputs, creating various JSON objects, and writing code to serialize and
                deserialize JsonNode arguments and
                responses.

            <p>Since the time I arrived at Northeastern as a freshman, I knew that one club I really wanted to join was
                Scout, Northeastern's
                student-led design studio. This club works on a variety of projects, from holding a large conference
                centered on design, to doing brand
                redesign for clients. What really reeled me in was their Studio division, whose primary focus is to take
                on real-world clients,
                and design and develop a solution to address their needs, usually in the form of a website. I knew from
                the get-go that I wanted to join
                the team as a developer, building websites that were planned by the team's designers.
            </p>
            <p>In the spring of my freshman year, I applied as a developer for the Studio teams, and I was accepted! My
                team's client was Venova, a birth-control
                brand that has developed a copper-free, hormone-free birth control solution. Our job was to create a
                website that provides information about
                their solution, team, testimonials, and a way to contact them. This website is intended to be an
                informational site to be viewed by patients,
                stakeholders, and investors.
            </p>
            <p>Working on this project was the first time I worked for a client. I learned a lot about what it means to
                obtain feedback from the client,
                understand the user's needs, and making necessary adjustments to the product along the way. Every week,
                I attended meetings where I saw the website
                being developed on Figma by the designers, using information, critiques, and ideas collected from the
                client.</p>

            <h3>bullet journal</h3>
            <a class="button" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/tracyyh/bulletJournal">view code</a>
            <p>Creating a functioning, visually cohesive, and assistive bullet journal was the last project for Object 
                Oriented Design. The key functions for the program were event and task creation that would be shown on a week 
                view, saving the bullet journal as files, and setting maximum numbers of events and tasks. From there, we 
                were tasked to gradually add features to the program, including preset and custom themes, queue of tasks, progress 
                bars of task completion, privacy lock, and a splash screen. For this project, we worked in teams of three.
            </p>
            <p>
                Within my group, I was the only student with a design background, so I took it upon myself to design the UI of the 
                program through SceneBuilder. This required thorough understanding of the JavaFx hierarchy, as the program's ability 
                to progress relied on proper use of flexible VBox's. Additionally, I created buttons with the ability to change the 
                colors of the program to either a preset theme or a theme of the user's choice using a color picker. I also worked on 
                setting up the task queue and progress bars, ensuring that checking off one box under a weekday would both check off 
                the box in the task queue as well as further the weekday's progress bar. Once this was completed, I worked on the 
                addition of a splash screen that featured a privacy lock. The splash screen was created with fading transitions 
                of a VBox that contained text for the privacy lock. The privacy lock on the screen is dependent on the name of the 
                user's system username. That allows for users to have different passcodes across different devices. 
            </p>
            <p>
                This bullet journal project was the project that I really had fun with. I had so much fun exploring the internet for 
                ways to incorporate my creative ideas into my code. A lot of the features that were implemented were not taught in class, 
                and it was incredibly invigorating seeing how creative I could get with my program.
